## Lessons Learned 📖

As my first project with React I learned that it is a very powerful library for building user interfaces. Based on components, it allows you to reuse them easily and mount or unmount from the dom only what has changed, providing a very pleasant experience for the user and the developer.
## Related 📒

You can compare it with my previous project made with Vanilla Javascript.
Although the specifications for this project led to it ending up being a little different in its interface, both wanted to represent the structure of an ecommerce.
